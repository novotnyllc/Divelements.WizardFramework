# Divelements.WizardFramework
Open source version of Divelements [WizardFramework](http://divelements.co.uk/net/controls/wizardframework/).

Tim Dawson has generously relicensed this control under an MIT license and [Claire Novotny](https://github.com/clairernovotn) will be maintaining it going forward.

There's unlikely to be significant development on this library, however bug fix PRs are always welcome.

Current plans are to multi-target to .NET Framework and .NET Core, then get a package up on NuGet.
